# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all contributors, users, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
