### 1. **Data Integration:**
   - **TMC Data (5m Resolution):**
     - Majority of the moon's surface coverage.
   - **OHRC Data (25cm Resolution):**
     - Limited but high-resolution coverage.
   - **Integration:**
     - Develop a strategy to integrate the OHRC data with the TMC data for regions where high-resolution information is available.

### 2. **Super-Resolution Techniques:**
   - **Utilize Deep Learning Models:**
     - Train a deep learning model to enhance the resolution of TMC data using available OHRC data.
     - Generate high-resolution features such as slopes, craters, boulders, and shadows using the super-resolved TMC data.

### 3. **Hazard Definitions:**
   - **Define Hazard Criteria:**
     - Slope Threshold (e.g., 10 degrees).
     - Crater and Boulder Depth/Height (e.g., 1m).
     - Analyze Crater Distribution.
     - Identify and account for shadows.

### 4. **Feature Extraction and Hazard Assessment:**
   - **Extract Features:**
     - Employ image processing techniques to identify relevant features based on hazard criteria.
   - **Assess Hazards:**
     - Use the identified features to assess potential hazards for landing.

### 5. **Real-time Navigation Techniques:**
   - **Lander Navigation System:**
     - Implement a navigation system that takes real-time data from the super-resolved hazard map.
     - Develop algorithms for real-time decision-making during the landing phase.

### 6. **Demonstration and Validation:**
   - **Showcasing Techniques:**
     - Create simulations or demonstrations showcasing how the lander navigates safely using the developed hazard map.
     - Emphasize adaptability to real-time updates and changing conditions.
   - **Validation:**
     - Validate the hazard map and navigation techniques against ground truth data or simulated scenarios.

### 7. **Visualization and User Interface:**
   - **User-Friendly Interface:**
     - Develop a user interface for mission control or operators to interact with the hazard map and navigation system.
     - Ensure easy interpretation of the hazard information.

### 8. **Documentation and Communication:**
   - **Document the Solution:**
     - Provide detailed documentation on the super-resolution techniques, hazard definitions, and navigation algorithms.
   - **Communication:**
     - Communicate findings, limitations, and successes to stakeholders and the wider space exploration community.

### Considerations:
- **Mission Constraints:** Consider mission-specific constraints, such as fuel limitations, communication delays, and the need for autonomous decision-making during the descent.
- **Collaboration:** Collaborate with experts in lunar geology, remote sensing, and space navigation to ensure a comprehensive and accurate hazard map.

### Finding Datasets:

1. **NASA Planetary Data System (PDS):**
   - Explore the PDS archives for lunar datasets: [NASA PDS](https://pds.nasa.gov/).
   - Specifically, look for the datasets related to Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) and Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC) on the moon.

2. **USGS Astrogeology Science Center:**
   - USGS provides lunar datasets and maps: [USGS Astrogeology](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/).
   - Look for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) data.

3. **Planetary Data Archive at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:**
   - Another resource for lunar datasets: [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://pds.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

### Sample Code Template:

Here's a Python code template that you can use as a starting point. This code assumes you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) and a specific dataset. Replace the dataset path and add relevant processing steps based on your actual data:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Replace with the actual path to your dataset
dataset_path = "/path/to/your/dataset"

# Load your dataset (replace this with your actual data loading code)
def load_dataset(path):
    # Your code to load the dataset
    # For example, you might use libraries like gdal or rasterio for geospatial data
    # Return the loaded data as a NumPy array
    pass

# Example: Load the TMC and OHRC data
tmc_data = load_dataset(dataset_path + "/tmc_data.tif")
ohrc_data = load_dataset(dataset_path + "/ohrc_data.tif")

# Example: Apply super-resolution techniques (replace with your actual super-resolution code)
def super_resolution(input_data, factor):
    # Your code for super-resolution
    pass

# Example: Apply super-resolution to TMC data using OHRC data
super_res_tmc_data = super_resolution(tmc_data, factor=5)

# Example: Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.title("Original TMC Data")
plt.imshow(tmc_data, cmap="gray")

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("Super-Resolved TMC Data")
plt.imshow(super_res_tmc_data, cmap="gray")

plt.show()
```
