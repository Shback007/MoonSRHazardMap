The "*Lunar Lander SafeTouch*" project addresses the challenge of limited high-resolution data coverage on the moon's surface by pioneering an innovative approach to lunar landing safety. Leveraging **Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)** images at `5m` resolution for `80% coverage` and sparse but high-resolution **Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC)** data at `25cm` resolution, this project employs state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques to create a hazard map with a `1m` grid spacing. The hazard map integrates essential hazard definitions, including slope thresholds, crater and boulder specifications, crater distribution analysis, and shadow considerations.
